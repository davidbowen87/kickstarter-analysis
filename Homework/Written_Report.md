# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of the project was to identify the value of successful Theater outcomes by month while also identifying theater kickstarters that have either failed or been canceled. Along with that information, we needed to identify outcomes based on goals and use that information to assist with identifying the ideal months and values to launch kickstarter campaigns in the future. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The analysis for the Outcomes Based on Launch Date was completed by filtering the parent category to Theater, then ranked on a monthly basis from most successful, failed then canceled. The total is also available so more information can be filtered or ranked.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The analysis for the Outcomes Based on Goals was completed by using the =COUNTIFS and =SUM functions from Excel. The count value for each campaign is collected from Successful, Failed and Canceled, then a percentage value is located to the right.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There were challenges in useing the =COUNTIFS function for collecting the Outcomes Based on Goals. Once I became more familiar with the function it became much easier to use and break information down. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The first conclusion that I drew from the Outcomes by Launch Date is that the highest success rates are during the months of May and June. I would recommend that more campaigns start in May and June based on this information.

The second conclusion that I drew is that the month of December has the lowest amount successful campaigns. I would recommend not launching as many campaigns during the month of December based on this information.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
I can conclude that the most successful percentage goes to campaigns with a goal of less than 1000. With this information, I can suggest that if we are looking to improve overall percentage of successfull campaigns, we should do more campaigns valued less than the 1000 threshold. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset currently does not filter by country or currency, I think we can run this information to better assist with presenting this information. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create tabled to filter country, showing percentage of the campaign results from value, an example would be if one campaign was successful by 130 percent. I think that information could be very helpful to identify which kickstarters should have more focus on them.
